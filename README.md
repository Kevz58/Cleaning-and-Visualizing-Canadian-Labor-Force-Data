# Cleaning-and-Visualizing-Canadian-Labuor-Force-Data

The goal of this project was to explore trends and changes in the Canadian labour force during the COVID-19 pandemic period (2019â€“2024). Using publicly available labour force survey data, the analysis focused on identifying shifts in employment patterns and wage dynamics. A key area of interest was how education level influenced hourly wages over time across various industries and provinces, particularly as the economy adjusted to the pandemic.

The analysis used Canadian February Labour Force Survey data from 2019 to 2024, accessed through UBC Abacus.

Data was cleaned and analyzed using R, while interactive visualizations were created in Tableau Public to clearly illustrate trends and insights.
